## FAQ 

### What can I use SveltePlot for?

Basically anything you want, except for building a tool that lets its users create and publish charts or maps. Most of all, you can use it to create charts and maps yourself.

### Can I use it in commercial products?

Yes, absolutely. There is no non-commercial restriction in the license. The only restriction we have is that the product you're using it in is not allowing its users to create and publish charts or maps.
