title: License

SveltePlot is released under a [non-free source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) custom license. It's based on the two-clause BSD license with an added condition that prevents the use of SveltePlot for building a user-facing charting tool like Datawrapper.

:::caution
3. You may not use this source code to build a user-facing software service for creating and publishing charts or maps, similar to Datawrapper.
:::

## Why on Earth did you pick this license?

The short anshwer is that we want to protect our [business](https://www.datawrapper.de/) by not giving away this source code to direct competitors. At the same time, we still want to allow everyone else to use it to build custom visualizations that exceed the scope of most charting tools.

## FAQ 

### What can I use SveltePlot for?

Basically anything you want, except for building a tool that lets its users create and publish charts or maps. Most of all, you can use it to create charts and maps yourself.

### Can I use it in commercial products?

Yes, absolutely. There is no non-commercial restriction in the license. The only restriction we have is that the product you're using it in is not allowing its users to create and publish charts or maps.

### Why can't I use it to create a charting tool?

The development of SveltePlot is funded by the Datawrapper GmbH, and therefor we try to avoid using it for competing use.
