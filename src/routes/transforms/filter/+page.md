title: Filter transform
---

The **filter transform** filters a mark’s index to show a subset of the data. For example, below the **filter** option controls which text labels are displayed in a dense scatterplot.

Since the filter transform only affects the mark’s index and not the channel values, it does not affect the default scale domains. Below, the x scale contains every English letter, even though the only the bars for the vowels are shown.
